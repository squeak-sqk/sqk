A high-performance package manager written in TypeScript, designed to be faster than npm, Yarn, and PNPM. SQK installs dependencies from the npm registry, caches them locally for speed, and generates a lockfile for consistency.

## Installation

Install globally via npm:
```bash
npm install @ratnia/sqk -g
```

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqk)
